## Questions
   i. Yes i do see a change in the plotted points. changing the x-final to 500 and y final to 10000, the plotted lines are nearly touching the x-axis. we see a drastic change in the individual linear functions.
  ii. I kind of see a change since y-final is changed to 20000, the program will have a harder time to squeeze the tick marks for the y-axis. it looks similar to the answer from number 1, but the linear function is closer to the x-axis and seems to be closer to one another (another linear function to another linear function).
 iii. as y_final increases, i do see many of the quadratic functions get closer together, meanwhile quadratic 2 seems to be further away like an outlier and is closer to the first linear function.
  iv. as y_final increases, i see that the linear functions also stay closer to each other, but one linear function (the first one) is relatively close to the quadratic 2. the remaining linear functions are getting closer to the x-axis and is closer to the other linear functions as i can see.
   v. we see the quadratics are not increasing as fast as the cubics. the cubics seem to be growing very very fast , especially when the y_final is 200000. the quadratic's behavior is not growing as fast as cubic at all. the quadratic looks to be on the same level as the linear too. 
  vi. the linear is way slower than the cubic functions. it is not growing as fast as the cubics especially when changing the y_final between 100000 and 200000. the linear function is still close to the x-axis, meanwhile the cubic function looks to be moving away from the y-axis and move towards the center of the graph plot.
 vii. the cubic function does not grow as fast as the exponential function. it looks to be moving at a slower pace than the exponential function. it appears to move away to the right from the exponential function when increasing y_final from 100000 to 200000. the exponential function appears to shoot straight upwards
 iii. the quadratics function in relation to the exponential appears to be very very smaller than the exponential. the quadratic functions appear to sit near the x-axis while the exponential function also looks to shoot straight upwards.
  ix. the linear function does not compare to growth with the exponential function. the linear function basically sits on the x-axis while the exponential function is growing and growing very very fast. the linear function is the slowest growing function.
   x. i believe this class exercise attempts to explain big-o notation where we can see functions at its ability when it reaches a large threshold. we see this happen when increasing y_final so the graphs of the functions will simulate growing functions are best when its growth rate is larger than other function's smaller rate.
