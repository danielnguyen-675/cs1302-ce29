## Questions
   i. Yes i do see a change in the plotted points. changing the x-final to 500 and y final to 10000, the plotted lines are nearly touching the x-axis. we see a drastic change in the individual linear functions.
  ii. I kind of see a change since y-final is changed to 20000, the program will have a harder time to squeeze the tick marks for the y-axis. it looks similar to the answer from number 1, but the linear function is closer to the x-axis and seems to be closer to one another (another linear function to another linear function).
 iii. as y_final increases, i do see many of the quadratic functions get closer together, meanwhile quadratic 2 seems to be further away like an outlier and is closer to the first linear function.
  iv. as y_final increases, i see that the linear functions also stay closer to each other, but one linear function (the first one) is relatively close to the quadratic 2. the remaining linear functions are getting closer to the x-axis and is closer to the other linear functions as i can see.
