## Questions
   i. Yes i do see a change in the plotted points. changing the x-final to 500 and y final to 10000, the plotted lines are nearly touching the x-axis. we see a drastic change in the individual linear functions.
  ii. I kind of see a change since y-final is changed to 20000, the program will have a harder time to squeeze the tick marks for the y-axis. it looks similar to the answer from number 1, but the linear function is closer to the x-axis and seems to be closer to one another (another linear function to another linear function).
